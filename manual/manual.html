<H1>Introduction</H1>

Presto is a pre-emptive priority-driven real time operating system with support
for timers, interprocess communcation, semaphores and dynamic memory.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<H2>A brief history</H2>

Early in my programming career, I was fascinated by multi-tasking systems.  I
got a special thrill the first time I wrote an interrupt service routine.  Here
was a unique piece of code that was executed outside of the main thread of my
host program.

<P>

This fascination quickly turned into a necessity when I was asked to add a
network interface to an existing product.  What evolved out of that project was
a cooperative multi-tasking scheduler.  Simply put, I kept a list of functions
that I needed to call, and I called them until they were all gone. Except each
time I called one function, new ones might be added to the list.  This simple
and elegant solution solved that particular problem, and that system is still
in production today.  But a deeper problem bothered me.

<P>

How could I pre-emptively swap between multiple threads?  What kind of magic
is involved in <I>stealing</I> the processor away from a task, and giving it
to another task?

<P>

This question is at the heart of Presto, and answering it has been the primary
inspiration behind the development of Presto.

<P>

As luck would have it, several things happened at nearly the same time, and so
the secrets of multi-tasking were revealed.  I decided to build a simple
single-board computer that would be me development platform.  My friend Greg
Preston convinced me to build a Motorola 68HC11-based "Handyboard".  Presto
takes its name from Greg's last name (plus it has a magical sound to it).  At
the same time, I read an article in <I>Circuit Cellar</I> magazine about a
simple time-slicing system that ran on the HC11.  I studied the example, and
how they carefully set the stack up and then generated an interrupt which
changed the stack pointer.  I now had enough knowledge to build my RTOS.

<P>

After a weekend of tinkering, I had my first prototype kernel swapping tasks.
It worked fairly well, but I had a small bug that caused the system to hang
after a few seconds of operation.  Little did I know, it would be four years
before I found and fixed that bug.

<P>

I studied the code, and I ran it on an emulator program, and I took the board
to work and run it on a logic analyzer, but the bug still eluded me.  Since I
was working full time and going to graduate school, I tended to put my project
on a shelf for months at a time.  When I did have time to devote to it, it was
often only a few hours, and I spent most of that time getting re-aquainted with
where I had left off.  I graduated.  I moved to Singapore.  I had a baby.
Where was I going to find some free time?

<P>

I decided that I needed to inspect every instruction that ran on the processor.
I stay up late after the baby went to sleep, surfing the net for every emulator
I could find.  I decided that they fell into two categories: those that
emulated the processor correctly but had horrible user interfaces, and those
that were easy to use but did not emulate the processor correctly.
Specifically, I needed to be able to run a million instructions without
pressing a button a million times.  And I needed to generate timer interrupts.

<P>

I finally gave up on the net, and wrote my own emulator.  It was tedious work,
but it was fun.  I compared the log files that I generated to the logs of the
other emulators to find potential bugs.  Wherever they differed, I consulted
the processor manual to see which one of us was correct.

<P>

Still the bug eluded me.  I moved back to the US.  We were about to have another
baby.  I knew that I could kiss those precious moments of free time away.  So
with time ticking away, I focused on the problem by running the simulator for
hours and generating huge log files.  I wrote a perl script that would read the
log files and summarize what was going on.  What function was the program counter
pointing to?  Where was the stack pointer pointing?  Was it within one of the
task stacks?

<P>

Eventually, my perl script determined that my stack pointer had drifted out of
one task's stack.  In fact, it had popped one too many bytes off of one task's
stack.  Depending on what was in that doomed location of memory, the result
might have been catastrophic, or it might have gone unnoticed.  Searching the
code, I quickly found that in one particular instance, the stack would get
clobbered.  It only occured when the kernel decided to re-evaluate which task
to run, and the winning task was the same one that was already running.  I
solved the problem that night, and it felt great.

<P>

The good news is that in the process of trying to find a bug over a period of
four years (sitting the project on a shelf for months at a time and dusting it
off again for a late night of bug-hunting), I wrote and re-wrote the entire
kernel a couple of times.  So it was an evolution of small improvements.


<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<H2>Presto today</H2>

Today, the goals of Presto are:

<UL>
<LI>Create something of beauty.</LI>
<LI>Hand-craft an embedded system with zero outside code (at first, I did not even link in libgcc!).</LI>
<LI>Create a tool for the amateur robotics community.</LI>
<LI>Have a platform to demonstrate how to write software under an RTOS.</LI>
<LI>Have a platform to learn more about embedded systems.</LI>
<LI>Learn how RTOS's work.</LI>
<LI>Teach real time systems concepts to others.</LI>
<LI>A commercial product (or service) as a side business?</LI> <LI></LI>
<LI></LI> </UL>

Presto has been structured with elegance and simplicity as primary goals.  It
is intended to be small and modular, and easily ported to new processor
architectures.  It is written almost entirely in C, with a few sprinkles of
inline assembly language (only where necessary, in the heart of the kernel).

<P>

I borrowed concepts that I had seen elsewhere, things that were pleasing in
their simplicity, and incorporated them into Presto.  Just before version 1.0,
I decided to change the basic metaphor that Presto used to schedule tasks.  In
the early days, everything was based on mail messages and a central post office
that could delay messages (to incorporate timers).  In the new metaphor, each
task contains several "ready bits" which can be waited on.  In the process of
making this change, I divided the code into the sections that you see today:
the core kernel, the task-switching peripherals (mail, timers, sempahores) and
dynamic memory management.

<P>

Presto is not the Cadillac of real time operating systems.  Instead, it is more
of a hand-crafted roadster.  I hope that you'll take it for a ride, and that
it will get you where you're going.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<H1>How Presto is organized</H1>

Presto is a priority-based pre-emptive multi-tasking RTOS.  Therefore, it
allows the user to create multiple independent tasks, each with their own
stack and context.  The cardinal rule of priority-based RTOS's is <I>the
highest priority 'ready' task always runs</I>.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<H2>Tasks and priorities</H2>

The user defines tasks before Presto starts.  Each task is made up of a "main"
function, a stack and a priority.  A task is created by calling the
<SPAN CLASS=FUNCTION>presto_task_create()</SPAN> function.

<SPAN CLASS=CODE><PRE><TT>
PRESTO_TASKID_T presto_task_create(
                   void (*func)(void),
                   BYTE * stack,
                   short stack_size,
                   PRESTO_PRIORITY_T priority);
</TT></PRE></SPAN>

The user simply provides the name of the task's main function to execute, a
pointer to an array to use as a stack, the size of the stack and a priority
number.

<P>

User tasks are numbered from
<SPAN CLASS=CONSTANT>0</SPAN>
to
<SPAN CLASS=CONSTANT>(PRESTO_KERNEL_MAXUSERTASKS-1)</SPAN>,
giving a total of
<SPAN CLASS=CONSTANT>PRESTO_KERNEL_MAXUSERTASKS</SPAN>
user tasks.  This makes it convenient to keep an array of items,
one for each user task (see the
<SPAN CLASS=VARIABLE>default_mailbox</SPAN>
array in
<SPAN CLASS=FILENAME>mail.c</SPAN>).
The idle task's task ID number equals
<SPAN CLASS=CONSTANT>PRESTO_KERNEL_MAXUSERTASKS</SPAN>.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<H2>Dynamic memory</H2>


<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<H1>The kernel</H1>

<P>

This module is the heart of Presto.  Here is where we keep our list of
tasks, and where we evaluate priorities to pick who runs.

<P>

In order to do pre-emptive multitasking, we have to perform context
switches.  This is a pretty simple operation, but it can be tricky to
get right.  Basically, all of the registers are saved to the stack and
then the stack pointer is saved in the task's TCB.  The new task's
stack pointer is read from its TCB, and then the registers are pulled
from that task's stack (remember, each task has its own stack).

<P>

The process of determining who should run next and then doing a context
switch has been cleanly encapsulated in an interrupt service routine.
That way, whenever some event happens that makes a new task ready, we
simply issue a SWI (software interrupt).

<P>

In order to tell if a task is ready to run or not, Presto uses "ready
bits" which I call "triggers".  Each task has eight triggers (this can
be changed in configure.h if needed).  If a task is waiting, then its
wait_flag will be set to something other than zero.  When one or more
of the triggers that it is waiting for becomes set, then that task will
become ready.

<P>

The tasks are kept in a linked list (in priority order), so it is easy
to traverse the list to find the highest priority ready task.  Presto
supports temporary over-riding of priorities (in which case the task
will be moved to a different place in the linked list).  This feature
is used by the "priority inheritance" feature of semaphores.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<H1>Mail</H1>

<P>

This module implements a simple and fast mechanism for passing messages
between tasks.  The metaphor used is that of mailboxes and envelopes.

<P>

A task can own one or more mailboxes.  Each mailbox has associated with
it, a "trigger" (or "ready bit").  When mail arrives in the mailbox, the
trigger is set.  If the task is waiting on that trigger, then the task
will become ready.

<P>

There is a little bit of overhead associated with keeping track of mail
messages.  This is primarily the "next" pointers in a linked list of
messages.  Rather than keep an arbitrary-sized list of mail messages
for each mailbox (which is limiting and inefficient), we require the
use of "envelopes".  Envelopes contain internal accounting data that
is needed to keep mail messages in lists, but they also contain some
useful information, like the sender of the message.

<P>

The user can decide whether to use static envelopes (stored on the stack
or globally) or dynamically allocated envelopes (from the heap).  It is
a good practice to allocate envelopes just before they are sent, and
then let the receiver free the envelope memory after he has read the
message.  Coincidentally, this practice mirrors what we do in real life
(sender buys, receiver throws away).

<P>

A task may have one mailbox, or it may have many mailboxes, or it may
have no mailboxes.  There are cases where it is useful to have more than
one mailbox.  For example, a serial port driver may have one mailbox for
traffic to pass along the line and a separate mailbox for flow control
messages (you would not want a flow control message to get stuck behind
lots of data -- you would want that message to be received immediately).
In most cases, however, one mailbox per task is sufficient.  To make
addressing easier, the first mailbox that a task initializes is it's
"primary" mailbox.  A task can change which mailbox is considered to be
its primary mailbox.

<P>

Messages can be sent to a specific mailbox, or they can be sent directly
to a task (in which case it is simply delivered to the task's primary
mailbox).  There are two "send" functions which cover these two options.

<P>

So what kind of messages can we send?  Most of the time, we are sending
simple instructions from one task to another.  "I am alive", or "please
scan the keyboard".  Other times, we need to send a lot of data.  Presto
sends two things in each mail message: an integer and a pointer.  For
simple messages, the integer will suffice (you can leave the pointer
NULL).  For more complex scenarios, the pointer can give the location of
a structure that has the needed information.  This pointer can point to
static (global) memory or to dynamic memory -- it is up to the user to
define a protocol for ownership of memory, and who frees what.  Again,
a good practice is to let the sender allocate and the receiver free.

<H1>Timers</H1>

<P>

This module implements a simple timer system.

<P>

Timers can be either one-shot or repeating.  They are specified by an
initial delay and then a period.  Timers can be started or stopped.

<P>

When a user wants to use a timer, he simply calls the start function,
which requires a delay, a period and a trigger.  When the timer expires,
the trigger is asserted on process which started it.  The user may then
wait for that trigger.

<P>

Since it is very common to simply delay for a little while, there is a
presto_timer_wait function which combines the timer declaration (on the
stack), the start with no repeat, and the wait.

<P>

TODO - Be smart about when to issue a timer interrupt.  Calculate how
long until the next timer expires, and then don't bother interrupting
until then.  This problem is harder than it seems at first!

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<H1>Semaphores</H1>

<P>

This module implements a simple semaphore mechanism.

<P>

These semaphores are used when one resource is shared among many users.
The semaphore should be initialized at the start of execution.  Then, when
a user wants to use the resource, he does a presto_semaphore_wait() on that
semaphore.  His task will be blocked until the resource becomes available.

<P>

If there are more than one resource (example: a pool of three printers),
then the semaphore can be initialized as a "counting" semaphore (more than
one resource) rather than a "binary" semaphore (one resource).

<P>

One common problem with resource locking is "priority inversions."  To
avoid this problem, this module supports priority inheritance, a practice
where a running task is promoted to the priority of the highest waiter.

<P>

A second problem with resource locking is "deadlock".  The only way to
avoid deadlock is to pay special attention to the order in which multiple
resources are reserved (do not let one task reserve A and then B, while
a second task reserves B and then A).

<P>

Currently, there is an arbitrary maximum to the number of tasks that
can request a semaphore at the same time.  This maximum is specified
by the constant PRESTO_SEM_WAITLIST in configure.h.  This constant
tries to find some middle ground between the need to make the semaphore
data stucture small in size, and the need to support "popular" resources.
Ideally, we would use a more dynamic scheme.  In practice, this constant
works just fine.  If we want to be safe at the expense of memory, we
can set PRESTO_SEM_WAITLIST to PRESTO_KERNEL_MAXUSERTASKS.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<H1>Dynamic Memory</H1>

<P>

This module implements a simple memory pool for fast dynamic memory
allocation.  It is flexible -- it can be configured to use several
pools of fixed sized "items" by changing a handful of constants in
configure.h.

<P>

There are two main data structures involved with keeping track of
memory allocation.  There are "pool" structures, which keep high level
information about a set of similar memory items (how big are the items,
how many are currently used, etc).  And then there are the memory items
themselves, which each keep track of one block of allocated memory.

<P>

The memory item structres are stored interleaved with the actual memory
that is allocated.  This makes it possible to find a specific memory
item, given only a pointer to the allocated memory.

<P>

Here is a simple example of the data strctures.
mempools: { 5 items, 3 bytes each, A-E }, { 4 items, 7 bytes each, F-I }
membytes: A111B222C333D444E555F6666666G7777777H8888888I9999999

<P>

In this example, there is a memory item A which precedes three bytes of
allocatable memory.  The structure in A contains information about those
three bytes: is it being used, which pool does it belong to, how many
bytes were actually requested (less than three?).  When the user asks
for up to three bytes, he is given a pointer to the "111" area.  When
he returns the memory to the pool, he gives us back the same pointer.
Using this pointer, we can go backwards a few bytes and see the structure
A, and we can return the memory to the pool where it belongs.
